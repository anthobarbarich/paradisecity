Furthermore, our camping area was 100 % powered on solar energy for 2 years in a row and we use 95% of low consumption lightning on site.</div>

This year, we are aiming to find a compost solution to improve our waste stream.<br><br>We have a limited waste flow (no paper flyers, no receipts, use of eco cups, free portable ashtrays etc.), In 2017, we succeeded in reducing our waste up to 35%, part of which 40% was recycled waste (PVC, glass and used oil).<br><br>We ask our food trucks to use only compostable silverware. And, if any, we collect the food surplus to be distributed to people in need.</div>
