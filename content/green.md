        lowers the impact of lighting & music. We encourage everyone involved in
        the festival to be aware of how much energy they use, while measuring,
        monitoring and reporting each year on energy usage. The last 2 editions
        were powered up only by renewable energy & using low consumption
        lightning on site.

        consists of 100 % locally sourced & organically grown food and
        ingredients from fair-trade source. Because of meat’s high climate &
        environmental impact, we propose a large range of vegetarian & meat free
        meals from our food providers. Menus are discussed internally in order
        to offer large & balanced alternatives. We also try to adapt food
        quantity to avoid leftovers.

        allows us, with our visitors’ participation, to sort, recycle and
        compost our waste. In order to minimize our waste stream, we have a
        “Zero single-used plastic” policy & we provide reusable cups for all
        drinks. We are also trying to implement a circular economy in regards
        with the waste generated by the festival.

        Transport modes have the biggest impact on our carbon footprint. So how
        will you get here? We are providing near entrance parking for
        sustainable transport modes with our bicycle point. We promote
        Carpooling and Public transports: the more people share a car or public
        transport, the lower the carbon footprint per passenger, the lower the
        carbon footprint per festival resident.

        Filtered tap water is available to avoid a wave of plastic water bottles
        which usually submerges festivals. Meet our less lucrative but more
        responsible alternative: Paradise City still & sparkling Tap Water.

<p class="txtblock">We are <strong>optimists</strong> and we think the <strong>future can be bright</strong>. Therefore, we need to take sustainability seriously, knowing that any gathering of a large number of people has a potential negative impact on air, soil, water, resources and people. We need to draw up less resources, and we decided to start with our own little festival and go <strong>full on for a green policy</strong>. We trust we can influence change by leaving a positive legacy and <strong>hopefully inspiring</strong> our visitors to live more <strong>sustainably</strong>. It’s with these ideas that we try to build our festival as green as possible, improving ourselves year after year and knowing that we still have a long way ahead of us</p>
