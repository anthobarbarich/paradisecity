Fine cuisine has always been one of the main pillars of Paradise City Festival. From our first edition in 2015 where we had a no fast food policy to the 2016 edition where we decided to ban meat from the festival, we always had a gastronomic experience with a prestigious chef at our Comfort zone.

## Culinary Curator

This year we are planning big things with our new culinary curator **Seppe Nobels**. For our citizens from Flanders, Seppe doesn’t need an introduction. For those who don't know him yet, Seppe is the chef of Graanmarkt 13 in Antwerp. He is considered as one of the top 5 vegetable chefs in the world. This year, and together with his team from Graanmarkt 13, Seppe will cook a 5-course dinner with a drink at our Comfort zone. You can find more details about the gastronomic experience here and you can reserve your ticket for this [here](https://shop.paylogic.com/124808/17501/tickets). 

But Seppe’s curatorship goes beyond the Comfort zone at Paradise City. He will have control over all the food offered at the festival and will respect some key principles: use of micro-local and seasonal vegetables, imperfectly shaped food that doesn’t get sold/would otherwise end up in the garbage, no sugar added, no meat and above all delicious food.

There will be a new restaurant (without reservation) at the festival and several foodtrucks. Seppe will have a say in all dishes offered, but will also make sure we use the micro-local vegetables from our farmer Ole Deschout in Heist-op-den-Berg (http://www.onslogischvoedsel.be). 

## Circular food

The food at the festival will be circular. That means that we will battle food waste and that Seppe will work besides the vegetables from Ole with unsaleable and imperfect food from our food partners. With this we are closing the loop and actively battling food waste without making any concessions on the quality of the dishes offered to you. 

Each year we want to push our sustainable policy a bit further, and the circular food will be our main green innovation for this year. Each dish at Paradise City will be cooked with the lowest carbon footprint possible.

We are faced with enormous challenges to save our planet, adapting our food habits will be a big part of the solution. The world population is quickly increasing, and we will have a lot of mouths to feed. For this reason, at Paradise City, we want to persuade you that local, vegetarian and circular
