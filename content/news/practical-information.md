Dear Citizens, Paradise City is just around the corner, time to share some practical information about the festival...

## TOP UP YOUR CREDITS IN ADVANCE

As you probably know we are a cashless festival, that means you will get a wristband with a chip on it.

Don’t forget to charge your wristband in advance by creating your personal account on **Playpass** and **avoid queuing** at Paradise City. You can also earn free credits if you pay with **Payconiq by Bancontact.**
Create your account : <https://account.playpass.eu/paradise-city-2019/signup>

## No need to personalize your ticket.

We are sorry for the hassle about personalizing your ticket. If you have not done it yet, do not worry, **you don’t have to put the name on your ticket.**

## TRANSPORT OPTIONS

There are many ways to come to Paradise City and we are asking our citizens to use a more **sustainable** way to lower our ecological footprint.
All info about transport can be found [here.](https://paradisecity.be/transport)

Watch out, for the ones coming by car, we’re trying to incentivize everyone to carpool. **Cars with less than 3 passengers will have to pay 5€ extra for their parking ticket.**
