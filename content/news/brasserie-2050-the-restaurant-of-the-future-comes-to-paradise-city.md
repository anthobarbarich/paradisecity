_Imagine a restaurant where you can taste the future. A future filled with healthy food for all. Well, here it is._

## **Taste the future**

The concept of Brasserie 2050 was created in 2018 by **Rabobank**, partnered with MOJO, The Food Line-up and Overtreders W. The bank’s mission: Growing a better world together. As Tom van Kuyk (Rabobank’s manager of brand experience and partnerships) puts it: in 2050 we’ll be **10 billion** people on earth. In order to sustain this growing population, food production has to raise by 60% and its ecological impact has to diminish by half. It’s imperative we start cultivating, producing and eating differently. With **Brasserie 2050**, we aim to provide a large public not only to see but also taste how that can happen.

## Boeuf-Bourguignon, without the beef

The menu has a variety options, ranging from bourguignon without beef and shoarma made with celeriac. Every meal is coupled with a problematic related to food such as **biodiversity** or salinizing farmlands. The meals are not only meant to tickle the festivalgoers’ taste buds, but also to **incentivize** critical thought. Maartje Nelissen of Food Line-up, responsible for the culinary concept: “After presenting the concept in the Netherlands last year, it’s great to be able to introduce it in Belgium also. Indeed, chef **Gilbert Kolff**, responsible for the menu, looks with **Seppe Nobles** for local farmers with which they can partner up, and how to best adapt the menu to the Belgian market.”

## Reusable restaurant

Next to its meals, Brasserie 2050 is also pursuing **sustainability** and looking to bring the component of **circular economy** in its activities. Therefore, the entire building is completely dismountable and **reusable**, composed with a **vertical farm**, tables made out of **recycled plastic**, and organic waste is **composted**. To reduce the CO2-impact, most of the products are sourced **locally** in order to reduce transport and make the whole process more transparent.
