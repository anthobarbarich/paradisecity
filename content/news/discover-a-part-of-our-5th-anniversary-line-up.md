Paradise City’ purpose has always been to highlight the cozy side of electronic music. When you’re on the dance floor, something happens. A positive and particular energy emerges. Our job goes further than programming only headliners. At Paradise City, we really want to introduce new talents and this year, we still support the local scene with all its great Belgian artists. Furthermore, we bring in la crème de la crème of the international scene for the pleasure of your ears. Three, two, one, let’s go: chills guaranteed!

## The highlights of the festival

Join the Norwegian producer Skatebård and the Spanish John Talabot on the Under My Garage stage on Friday. They’re unquestionably some of our favorite producers and selectors. The first one for his disco-italo productions – remember the famous "Agfachrome RSX II" released two years ago – and the second one because once he started you can’t take your eyes off him. 

What a better way to start Saturday afternoon on the Play Label stage than to enjoy a set by Motor City Drum Ensemble? This 34-year-old German artist is undoubtedly an icon and one of the best of his kind. Don’t take our word for it, have a look at his Selectors 001 selection for Dekmantel Festival. With finesse and emotion, he mixes melodic house, funk and disco tracks. The Brussels label Play Label will also welcome the talented Carista in the late evening. Groove is on the menu! 

Sunday is likely to be very hectic... Hope you still have a brain after this journey! The presence of the Belgian duo 2manydjs will be unmissable. The two brothers are what we can call legends - through their influence, their Deewee label and their other project Soulwax. We are more than delighted to welcome this duo for the first time, who represents the Belgian electronic music so well on the international scene. A very particular energy will set Arena Stage on fire on Sunday!

The performance of the British artist Vaal will follow. In the last four years, she has developed a strong identity and her name is now associated with the Afterlife family. She fills her songs with recordings of instruments she plays. On the Nico Morano and Friends stage, she will share her love for electronic music and take you to another planet.

The last couple of highlights that come to mind will play on the Silo stage. DJ Koze is pleased to be back for the second year in a row. He’s been dominating the electronic scene for a few years now and his latest album Knock Knock Knock, released last year, once more confirmed his limitless talent. When he played "Pick Up" at our previous edition, minds were lost! And who better to close this scene than Dixon? Closing set are always special moments… He will give it all, and more. Remember last year with Laurent Garnier... Since we’re expecting more people than ever, we will keep the other stages open and we are sure the energy will remain high on every stage. With Dixon, expect to be surprised. Each of his sets leaves crowds voiceless. More than enough to end the festival in a proper way!

## This year’s discoveries

Does Daphni really need an introduction? Member and singer of the emblematic group Caribou, he is also an outstanding producer and selector. His album Fabriclive 93, released in 2017, is a real nugget, with a personal crush on "The Truth". We are eager to welcome him behind the decks to close the ABSTRKT stage on Sunday evening.

We also welcome Nosedrip this year, a young Belgian who is rapidly gaining notoriety thanks to the quality of his sets. He mixes and moves from one style to another: from new age, new wave, French psych to minimal synth and post-punk. We can only advise everyone to come and discover his selector talents on Friday on the Under My Garage stage. The American Eris Drew will follow just after to remind us that "Music has been here since the beginning".

Finally, Paradise City will present its very first resident: Lola Haro. Lola is a 21-year-old young Antwerp woman with a real talent for digging. She spends her days at Wally's Groove World, one of Antwerp's most famous vinyl stores. She finds real treasures in all styles of music. Displaying remarkable skill, she produces energetic sets, full of good vibes. Come and discover on the Play Label stage on Saturday!

## Live performances

Every year, we try to draw as much attention as possible to our live scene. This year, live artists all have something special. On Friday, we meet the impressive artists Mim Suleiman & Esa. Esa introduces electronic music to young people through educational programs in South Africa, his home country, in other African countries and in Cuba. Mim Suleiman is a recognized and admired vocalist. She sings in English and Swahili, her native language (she was born in Tanzania). She often collaborates with the American producer Maurice Fulton, like in this song, "Nyuli". It is an honor to welcome such a duo to Paradise City: two charismatic and talented artists who are inspired by music from all over the world. Auntie Flo, who frequently works with Esa, will also deliver a live performance on Friday, accompanied by his live band.

On Saturday, the American producer DJ Python will go from low-fi house melodies to techno track, ambient or breakbeat. Right after, you’ll get to meet the Neapolitan duo Nu Guinea and their eight accompanying musicians. Performances you can’t miss before the start of the evening. The rendez-vous is taken on Sunday with Jungle By Night. We recently discovered them at a concert at L’Ancienne Belgique and these nine young musicians truly impressed us. Each one plays a different instrument on stage and together, they deliver something very exciting. To get you in the mood, listen to their latest album Livingstone, released on Rush Hour. It’ll make you dance from start to finish!

## Last surprise: a fourth stage is coming!

In order to maintain the intimacy of the festival and to ensure that you have enough space to dance, a fourth stage will be built, on water, for the first time! We are very proud to host the German collective Giegling on this stage. For two days, Giegling artists, including Map.ache, Eli Verveine and Edward, will play on the water for festivalgoers. If you don't know the collective yet, listen to Molly's EP Waves released last January. Our favorite: "Si seulement".

Of course this is just a small part of the 67 artists that will perform at Paradise City this year, keep discovering them before the festival through our [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/paradisecityfestival/playlist/0Bi3SbSebLcjScrqncVGhk?si=WzyclPt7QQ-mMBvzruq5CQ)!
