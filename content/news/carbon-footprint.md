Sustainability is in our festivalâ€™s DNA since day 1. 

It implies taking into consideration various aspects regarding its organisation and its process, gathering many data in order to be sure to improve the festival's ecological impact for each edition. And we are very proud to realize, year after year, that our strict policies are effective and that, thanks to our citizens, we are reducing our impact on the planet. This video shows how we achieve it and what are the steps that we should still implement to further reduce our inevitable CO2 consumption.
