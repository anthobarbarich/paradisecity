Sustainability is in our festival’s DNA since day 1. 

It implies taking into consideration various aspects regarding its organisation and its process, gathering many data in order to be sure to improve the festival's ecological impact for each edition.

This video shows how we achieve it and what are the steps that we should still implement to further reduce our inevitable CO2 consumption.
