2019 marks our 5th anniversary and our excitement is mounting to deliver the most special edition to date. The Paradise City recipe has been quite simple from the start in 2015: mix the best electronic music on offer with open minded people and a strong effort to minimize our ecological footprint. Meanwhile our intention has always been a dancefloor packed with energy, where people dance, live euphoric moments and connect with the artists and each-other. 

For our **5th birthday** we want to impress our music loving community with a very special line-up. We also want to surprise you by making some bold changes to the festival site. But we can’t reveal it all here. 

Thank you, dear Citizen, for making Paradise City such a warm place. Each year we are deeply touched with your positive energy.  So let’s do it all over again on **July 5,6 & 7. **

_Welcome to your festival, Welcome back to Paradise City!_
