As you probably know we are a cashless festival, that means you will get a wristband with a chip on it.On this chip you’ll have to load up money to be able to buy drinks and food.\
For a seamless Paradise City experience you should consider putting credits on your personal account before the festival weekend.

Just as last year we are partnering up with Payconiq by Bancontact, they will offer you 2 major advantages!

##  Free credits

The first one is that Payconiq by Bancontact will offer you the possibility to buy credits in advance and get free credits!
This way you avoid waiting in line at the festival and you'll be able to enjoy a free cold beer.

**How does it work?**

Create your personal account here : <a href="https://account.playpass.eu/paradise-city-2019/login">https://account.playpass.eu/paradise-city-2019/login</a>.
Fill in the barcode of your ticket so that all is linked and you can charge money on your account.
If you want to benefit from free credits pay with Payconiq by Bancontact and if you don’t have the Payconiq by Bancontact app yet, download it here : <a href="http://onelink.to/payconiqbe">Payconiq App</a>.
You can gain:

\- 5 free-credits for 100 credits bought

\- 10 free-credits for 150 credits bought


## No queuing at the festival

The second advantage is brand new and will change the way you enjoy our festival. Thanks to the Payconiq by Bancontact app you will be able to scan the QR code that's on your wristband's chip and directly (send money) add credits on it. No time lost queuing in line to recharge your wristband and way more time to spend on the dance floor!
