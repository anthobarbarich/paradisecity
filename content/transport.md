Go to http://fietsnet.be and follow the junctions to our festival, from your location. Our festival is located in Perk, right next to junction 56. Whilst on the road you don’t have to worry about anything but to follow the signs on your chosen route to the festival.

## Carpooling BY UBER

Uber, the mobile app that connects riders with drivers in more than 450 cities worldwide, is setting up a unique carpooling solution for Paradise City Festival. You get a 25 euro discount on your rides between Brussels and Perk if you share it through the Uber app with another friend.

**How do you share a ride?**

**Request an Uber;**

* Click on the driver’s info and select “Split Fare” icon at the bottom left of the screen;
* Choose the two friends you want to ride with;
* Tap “Send”.
* Your friends then:
* Tap the link in the text message from Uber;
* Your friends who don’t have an Uber account will be prompted to download the app and sign up;
* Your Uber-savvy friends will be taken directly to the Uber app;
* Your friends will need to confirm they want to split your fare.
* That’s it!

For Uber and Paradise City, the aim of this partnership is to further reduce CO2 emissions, but that is not all. As the third partner in the project, CO2Logic is there to ensure that the calculated CO2 emissions from these carpooling trips are offset by investing in climate projects coordinated by the Belgian company. It goes without saying that this carbon-neutral carpooling service is not only intended for festival-goers living in Brussels, but for everyone coming to Paradise City through the capital.

_Conditions_  : The code **PARADISE18** must be applied to enjoy a ride to/from Paradise City. This offer is only available from 29/6 until 02/07 (01am). You can only share a ride through the Uber app. People who share a ride need to have an Uber account. Discount is 25euro. If the trip fair exceeds 25euro, the remaining amount will be charged and splitted between all users’ credit cards.

**Carpooling BY ZIPCAR**

If you come from Brussels use a shared car from Zipcar. Hundreds of cars are readily available in the streets of Brussels. You can simply open them in the Zipcar Brussels App, drive to Paradise City and leave the car in the dedicated Zipcar parking area. If you decide to also drive back in a Zipcar at night, just don’t drink and drive.

And what’s best… Zipcar offers all Paradise City visitors 100 minutes of free driving credit. That means you can get to the festival and/or drive back to Brussels… for free! Just use the promotional code ‘**PARADISE**’ when registering on www.zipcar.be or in the App.
