    question: WHAT ARE THE FESTIVAL OPENING HOURS?
  - answer: 'Right here : https://paradisecity.be/timetable/friday'
    question: WHERE CAN I FIND THE LINE-UP?
  - answer: "People with wheelchairs get free access to the comfort area. There’s a disability parking close to the entrance of the festival. You will be allowed to park there after showing your personal parking card. Further, there will be dedicated toilets on site.\r\n\n\r\n\nWe are trying our best to make the festival accessible to all, but we cannot guarantee that moving around in a wheelchair will be easy (grass, etc). \r\n\nThere are risks of getting stuck (risk of entanglement?) if it rains, because the ground is not hard.\n\n \n\nFor more information, please contact us on info@paradisecity.be"

transport:
  - answer: >-
      It goes without saying that we recommend you to use your bike or public
      transport to get to the festival. The bike racks will be lit at night.


      Go to http://fietsnet.be and follow the junctions to our festival, from
      your location. Our festival is located in Perk, right next to junction 56.


      Whilst on the road you don’t have to worry about anything but to follow
      the signs on your chosen route to the festival.

      Seriously guys? Is it not clear enough on the website? Anyways, here’s a
      link: [www.paradisecity.be/tickets](www.paradisecity.be/tickets)
    question: WHERE CAN I BUY TICKETS?
  - answer: >-
      Yes of course… if you don’t go. The ticket doesn’t have to be registered
      in your name or match your identification. There is only one rule: one
      ticket = one person. 


      Note that your Wristband is not transferable (don’t think you can share it
      with your BF).


      If you want to sell your ticket to a friend, no problem.
    question: CAN I SHARE MY WEEKEND TICKET WITH A FRIEND?
  - answer: >-
      You can buy tickets for someone else. Note that there is a limit of 10
      tickets per order.
    question: HOW MANY TICKETS CAN I ORDER?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, you’ll be able to buy ticket at the entrance if Paradise City is not
      sold out. Last year Saturday was sold out, so we recommend buying your
      ticket upfront. Also, tickets will be 10euro more expensive at the door.
      Just so you know.
    question: IS THERE A TICKET OFFICE  AT THE FESTIVAL?
  - answer: >-
      No honey, stop dreaming. You can buy your tickets for the afterparty for
      Sunday. Also many unofficial afterparties are happening in Perk on Friday
      and Saturday.
    question: DOES MY TICKET TAKE ME TO THE AFTERPARTY?
  - answer: >-
      Nope! Everybody’s welcome at Paradise City Festival and kids below 12
      years even enter free of charge. However, all kids below 18 have to be
      accompanied by their parents.  


      Alcohol will only be sold to people over 18! 


      Please mind their ears and provide protection for the younger once. We
      have free earplugs available at the festival.

      "At the entrance of Paradise City, we will scan and link your ticket to
      your wristband. Once it is activated you can check in and check out at the
      festival during your stay by scanning your wristband with one of our Staff
      members.


      To charge your wristband with credit you can use one of our many cash
      desks, special unmanned Cashless Top-ups, or you can even charge your
      wristband with our Paradise City APP (which you’ll be able to download on
      the Apple Store and Play Store soon).


      When you want to have a cool drink, or buy some food at one of our
      delicious food trucks, you just have to scan your wristband at one of our
      bars/food trucks, it’s as simple as that! Note that we use reusable cups
      and that they have a recoverable deposit.




      You can also buy your credits when purchasing your ticket at the ticket
      shop, with a discount (you can already buy them on the website).

      ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS WITH WRISTBAND? WHY ELECTRONIC PAYMENT? HOW DOES IT
      WORK?
safety:
  - answer: >-
      "There is a first aid station permanently present on site, clearly marked
      on the festival terrain and map. Please be aware that these people stand
      in for your safety and the safety of your loved ones, so it’s highly
      recommended to follow their instructions carefully. 


      The Security team is also available on and around the festival.


      "
    question: HOW ABOUT SECURITY AND FIRST AID ON AND AROUND THE FESTIVAL PREMISES?
camping:
  - answer: >-
      We provide a campsite next to the festival grounds on the domain of
      Ribaucourt.




      Paradise City is the first festival offering a comfortable and super
      sustainable camping experience. We recommend people not to bring their own
      tents but use ours, you can reserve one on our webshop.
      (https://shop.paylogic.com/122150/17501/accommodation/camping)


      If you decide to bring your own, you’ll have to pay a warranty. At the end
      of the festival, you’ll get it back after we confirm that you left your
      camping place clean and tidy.  


      As you may know, every year a lot of stuff is left behind on festival
      campsites after a festival is finished. This includes bottles and glasses,
      but also tents! To be more specific: 1 in 4 people leave their tent behind
      on the various campsites worldwide! People feel hungover and tired, and
      don’t feel like folding up their tent. As you can imagine this causes a
      lot of waste and it is not all too good for the environment… after only a
      single use all these tents will go to the garbage dump!


      No worries, we’ve got you covered: meet our circular camping where each
      camper has the opportunity to rent recycled camping gear! How cool is
      that? https://paradisecity.be/meet-paradise-circular-inn/ 




      To access the campsite, you must be in possession of a valid camping
      wristband. You will receive your wristband at the campsite cash register.


      Don’t forget to bring your ID! No ID = no entry! One ticket is valid for
      one entrance per person.
    question: WHERE TO STAY DURING THE FESTIVAL?
