  - answer: >-
      Seriously guys? Is it not clear enough on the website? Anyways, here’s a
      link: [www.paradisecity.be/tickets](www.paradisecity.be/tickets)
    question: WHERE CAN I BUY TICKETS?
  - answer: >-
      Yes of course… if you don’t go. The ticket doesn’t have to be registered
      in your name or match your identification. There is only one rule: one
      ticket = one person. 


      Note that your Wristband is not transferable (don’t think you can share it
      with your BF).


      If you want to sell your ticket to a friend, no problem. If you want to
      change or cancel a ticket you’ve bought, that’s fine too.
    question: CAN I SHARE MY WEEKEND TICKET WITH A FRIEND?
  - answer: >-
      You can buy tickets for someone else. Note that there is a limit of 10
      tickets per order.
    question: HOW MANY TICKETS CAN I ORDER?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, you’ll be able to buy ticket at the entrance if Paradise City is not
      sold out. Last year Saturday was sold out, so we recommend buying your
      ticket upfront. Also, tickets will be 10euro more expensive at the door.
      Just so you know.
    question: IS THERE A TICKET OFFICE  AT THE FESTIVAL?
  - answer: >-
      No honey, stop dreaming. You can buy your tickets for the afterparty for
      Sunday. Also many unofficial afterparties are happening in Perk on Friday
      and Saturday.
    question: DOES MY TICKET TAKE ME TO THE AFTERPARTY?
  - answer: >-
      Nope! Everybody’s welcome at Paradise City Festival and kids below 12
      years even enter free of charge. However, all kids below 18 have to be
      accompanied by their parents.  


      Alcohol will only be sold to people over 18! 


      Please mind their ears and provide protection for the younger once. We
      have free earplugs available at the festival.
    question: IS THERE A MINIMUM AGE?
transport:
  - answer: >-
      It goes without saying that we recommend you to use your bike or public
      transport to get to the festival. The bike racks will be lit at night.


      Go to http://fietsnet.be and follow the junctions to our festival, from
      your location. Our festival is located in Perk, right next to junction 56.


      Whilst on the road you don’t have to worry about anything but to follow
      the signs on your chosen route to the festival.
    question: HOW DO I GET TO PARADISE CITY?
  - answer: >-
      **We have three lines: **


      1. Hasselt – Leuven/Louvain – Perk

      2. Antwerpen/Anvers – Mechelen/Malines – Perk

      3. Gent/Gand – Perk


      You need to buy a ticket for these busses:

      There are also busses from Vilvoorde station on Friday and Saturday:

    question: ARE THERE BUSES?
