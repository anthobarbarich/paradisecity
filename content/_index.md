## 2019 marks our 5th anniversary and our excitement is mounting
to deliver the most special edition to date. The Paradise City
recipe has been quite simple from the start in 2015: mix the
best electronic music on offer with an open minded crowd and a
strong effort to minimize our ecological footprint. Meanwhile
our intention has always been a dancefloor packed with energy,
where people dance, live euphoric moments and connect with
the artists and each-other.

For our 5th birthday we want to impress our music loving
community with a very special line-up. We also want to surprise
you by making some bold changes to the festival site. But we
can’t reveal it all here.

There is a tremendous momentum for climate action in Belgium today,
it’s great to see that people are standing up and claiming the climate.\
At Paradise City we have a purpose, we utterly believe that the
future can be bright but that we all need to make an effort to lower
our ecological impact. That is why we are putting so much energy in our Green policy.
That is also why you won’t find any meat or single used plastics on our festival.
Our generation is standing up and claiming more climate action

Thank you, dear Citizen, for making Paradise City such a warm
place. Each year we are deeply touched with your positive energy.
So let’s do it all over again on July 5,6 & 7.

The countdown has begun…come and join us!
