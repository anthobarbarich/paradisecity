 Paradise City’s purpose has always been to highlight the cozy side of electronic music. When you’re on the dance floor, something happens. A positive and particular energy emerges. Our job goes further than programming only headliners. At Paradise City, we really want to introduce new talents and this year, we still support the local scene with all its great Belgian artists.</description>

      <description>Sustainability is in our festival’s DNA since day 1.
It implies taking into consideration various aspects regarding its organisation and its process, gathering many data in order to be sure to improve the festival&amp;rsquo;s ecological impact for each edition. And we are very proud to realize, year after year, that our strict policies are effective and that, thanks to our citizens, we are reducing our impact on the planet. This video shows how we achieve it and what are the steps that we should still implement to further reduce our inevitable CO2 consumption.</description>

      <description>2019 marks our 5th anniversary and our excitement is mounting to deliver the most special edition to date. The Paradise City recipe has been quite simple from the start in 2015: mix the best electronic music on offer with open minded people and a strong effort to minimize our ecological footprint. Meanwhile our intention has always been a dancefloor packed with energy, where people dance, live euphoric moments and connect with the artists and each-other.</description>
