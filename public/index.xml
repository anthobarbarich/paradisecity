      <description>Sustainability is in our festival’s DNA since day 1.
It implies taking into consideration various aspects regarding its organisation and its process, gathering many data in order to be sure to improve the festival&amp;rsquo;s ecological impact for each edition. And we are very proud to realize, year after year, that our strict policies are effective and that, thanks to our citizens, we are reducing our impact on the planet. This video shows how we achieve it and what are the steps that we should still implement to further reduce our inevitable CO2 consumption.</description>

      <description>2019 marks our 5th anniversary and our excitement is mounting to deliver the most special edition to date. The Paradise City recipe has been quite simple from the start in 2015: mix the best electronic music on offer with open minded people and a strong effort to minimize our ecological footprint. Meanwhile our intention has always been a dancefloor packed with energy, where people dance, live euphoric moments and connect with the artists and each-other.</description>

      <description>We are optimists and we think the future can be bright. Therefore, we need to take sustainability seriously, knowing that any gathering of a large number of people has a potential negative impact on air, soil, water, resources and people. We need to draw up less resources, and we decided to start with our own little festival and go full on for a green policy. We trust we can influence change by leaving a positive legacy and hopefully inspiring our visitors to live more sustainably.</description>
